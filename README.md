# ESC/POS CUPS Raster Driver - rastertofoxus

## Introduction

Driver for printing receipts with brandless Chinese POS printers.

## Instalation

The CUPS image development headers are required before compilation. In Ubuntu, these can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libcupsimage2-dev

The easiest way to install from source is to run the following from the base directory:

    make
    sudo make install

This will install the filter and PPD files in the standard CUPS filter and PPD directories
and show them in the CUPS printer selection screens.
